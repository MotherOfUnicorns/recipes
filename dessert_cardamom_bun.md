## Ingredients

- 325ml whole milk
- 50g butter
- 500g flour
- 75g caster sugar
- 8 green cardamom pods
- 1/4 small black cardamom (optional)
- 2 tsp fine sea salt
- 7g instant yeast
- 1 egg

- 75g butter
- 80g cashew paste
- 40g caster sugar
- 3 tbsp creme fraiche
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/4 tsp sea salt


### Topping

- 1 egg
- almond flakes / pistachio crumbles (optional)


## Preparations

### Dough

- In a small pan, add milk (325ml) and butter (50g). Turn on heat until mixture is almost boiling, and let cool while assembling the other ingredients.
- Take out the seeds from green (8) and black (1/4) cardamom pods, and pound to a powder in a mortar and pestle. Alternatively, use a spice grinder.
- In a large mixing bowl, sift in flour (500g), and add sugar (75g), cardamom powder, salt (2 tsp), instant yeast (7g). Mix well.
- Beat one egg, and add to the dry mixture.
- Also add the (now warm and not scaling) milk-butter mixture.
- Mix everything well for form a nice dough.
- Transfer dough in an oiled container and let it rise overnight.

### Filling

- You can do this the night before or right before baking.
- Simply mix everything together until you get a almost smooth paste. This could take some time depending on how you do it. I used a mortar and pestle.


### Assemble & Bake

- Take the dough out of fridge and let it rest for 30 min.
- Lightly flour a working surface and transfer the dough on top. Slowly roll it out to a rectangle of roughly 30 by 50 cm. (Try to make this as uniform as possible, but in the end they will still taste good however the shape.)
- Spread the filling to half of the rectangle lengthwise (15 by 50 cm).
- Fold the other half over, and press gently to let out any air bubbles.
- Cut the dough into roughly 20 strips, and individually twist and shape them. (There are many ways to do it, such as [this](https://youtu.be/iGvTEdLF_VA?t=259), [this](https://youtu.be/QkfaMT6EJt4?t=276), or [this](https://youtu.be/N0g8hyUGcvk))
- Preheat oven to 200 degrees Celsius.
- Place the shaped buns on a baking sheet, cover with cling film and let rest for 15 minutes until they puff up slightly.
- Beat one egg for topping, and glaze each bun with the egg wash. Optionally, scatter with almond flakes / pistachio crumbles.
- Bake in preheated over for 20 minutes until golden brown.
- Let cool.
- Eat.
