## Ingredients

- 455 g all-purpose flour
- 2 tbsp butter
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 7 g yeast
- 270 g warm water
- milk or egg wash (optional, for brushing)

## Preparations

- Mix flour, butter, sugar, salt, yeast, and water. Knead into a smooth dough.
- Cover and let rest for a few hours.
- Uncover, knead again to remove most air. Divide into 12 portions, and form each into a smooth ball.
- Line the inside of a large baking tray with baking paper, and arrange the 12 balls in the tray, leaving some space between each.
- Cover with a towel and let proof for another 40 minutes.
- In the meantime, preheat oven to 200 degrees Celsius.
- After proofing is done, the buns should now be roughly double in size and touching each other.
- Optionally brush some milk or egg wash for better browning.
- Bake for 25 minutes until the top of the buns are brown.
- Remove from oven and let cool on a wire rack.
