# Pasta

Makes about 12 servings.

## Ingredients

- 1000 g all-purpose flour
- 435 g egg yolk (Or use whole eggs and adjust the amount of water)
- 200 g water
- 3 tsb salt


## Preparations & Cooking

- Mix everything into a dough, and let rest for around 15 minutes.
- (If making a big batch, you can either freeze the dough now, or first make pasta and then freeze the pasta, but this would take more space).
- Divide the dough into manageable chunks, and use a pasta maker to shape the pasta into your desired shape and thickness.
- Cooking time for this fresh pasta is around 3 minutes.
