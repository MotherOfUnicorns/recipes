# Massaman Paste

Based on a photo on the internet which I can't find anymore.

This should give you a small jar of curry paste that can last for months when refrigerated. Feel free to scale it down and leave out some of the ingredients you can't find.

## Ingredients

- 8 big dried red chilis
- 3 piece cloves
- 2 tsp coriander seed
- 2 tsp cumin seed
- 2 tsp star anise
- 20 pieces black peppercorn
- 5 pieces cardamom
- one small piece of cinnamon, or 1 tsp cinnamon powder
- 2 tsp salt
- 4 tsp kaffir lime leaves
- 2 tbsp garlic
- 2 tbsp galangal (can be substituted with dried powder, aka laos)
- 4 tbsp lemongrass
- 4 tbsp shallot
- some amount of fresh coriander root, if you can find it

## Preparations

- Roast all dry ingredients (chili, cloves, coriander seed, cumin seed, star anise, black peppercorn, cardamom, cinnamon) on a low flame until fragrant.
- In the mean time, chop up the wet ingredients (lime leaves, garlic, galangal, lemongrass, shallot, coriander root).
- When the dry ingredients are cool, grind them to a powder With a mortar and pestle. (You might have to do this in several batches depending on how much curry paste you plan to make. Also the dried chilis can be difficult to grind finely; you can use a food processor to make life easier.) 
- Grind the wet ingredients to a paste. Salt will help speed up the process.
- Combine thoroughly, and refrigerate.
