# Pita

Fresh pita. This is around 4 servings.


## Ingredients

- 280 g all-purpose flour
- 70 g whole-wheat flour
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 2 tsp yeast
- 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 240 ml warm water (~40 degrees Celsius)


## Preparations

- Mix everything together, and knead for 10 minutes.
- Shape the dough into a ball, coat with a splash of olive oil, and let rest in a tightly covered clean bowl for 1 hour.
- Divide the dough into 8 equal portions. Shape each portion into a smooth ball.
- Cover with a towel and let rest for 10 minutes on the counter.
- Using extra flour to prevent sticking, roll out each ball into thin rounds (around 5 mm thick).
- Cover with a towel again and let rest for 30 minutes.

### Cooking

- Method 1 - using the oven:
    - Preheat oven to the highest setting (200 degrees Celsius for me).
    - Bake (in batches) until the pitas puff up.
- Method 2 - using a large Dutch oven / heavy-duty pot:
    - Heat up on high until the pot smokes.
    - Add the pita one at a time, flip after one side is slightly browned.
