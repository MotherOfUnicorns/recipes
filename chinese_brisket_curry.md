# 咖喱牛腩(Hong Kong style brisket curry)

Probably my favourite dish from Hong Kong.

## Ingredients

- 500 g beef brisket
- 1 tbsp ginger
- 1 spring onion
- 1 red onion
- 1 carrot
- a few potatoes
- (optional) green/red chili, chili powder, chili flakes to taste
- 2 tbsp curry powder (I used a Surinamese roti mix, which worked pretty well)
- 1 tsp five-spice powder
- 1 star anise
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 inch cinnamon
- 2 slices dried licorice or black cardamoms (or both)
- 1 tbsp coriander seeds
- (optional) fresh or dried lemon grass
- beef stock/bouillon
- 200 ml coconut milk
- 1 tbsp Thai chili paste


## Preparations

- Slice ginger and cut the white part of spring onion in to inch-long sticks.
- Cut brisket into big chunks.
- In a large pot, add brisket chunks, ginger slices, spring onion white, and enough cold water to submerge the meat. Add a splash of Shaoxing wine if you have that on hand.
- Turn on heat until the water comes to a boil.
- Drain the water, rinse the meat clean with warm water, and reserve.

- Slice onions.
- Cut potatoes and carrots into bite-sized chunks
- In a pressure cooker, heat up some oil. Add onion slices and a little salt, and cook until caramelised.
- Add all spices (curry powder, five-spice powder, star anise, bay leaf, cinnamon, licorice, black cardamoms, coriander seeds, lemon grass, chili flake/powder. Cook until fragrant.
- Add potatoes and carrots. Stir.
- Add meat. Stir.
- Add most of the coconut milk (reserve a bit to drizzle on top in the end).
- Add stock and enough water to cook the meat.
- Turn heat on high. After pressure builds up, lower the heat and cook for 30 min.
- Release the pressure. Add Thai chili paste and salt to taste.
- Serve with rice or noodles. Drizzle some of the leftover coconut milk on top.
