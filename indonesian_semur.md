A recipe we learnt while traveling in Bukit Lawang in North Sumatra, Indonesia.

This makes about 4 servings.


## Ingredients

### curry paste

- half piece lemongrass, white part only
- half red onion (this is for regular sized onions. 5 tiny ones)
- 3 cloves garlic
- 3 candle nut (can be substituted with macadamia, cashew, or walnut)
- 5 green chili
- 1tsp caraway seeds
- 1 piece ginger
- 1 tbsp tomato concentrate, or a few fresh tomatoes

### dry spice mix

- 2 star anise
- 2 white cardamoms (or green, since we don't have white ones in the pantry)
- 1 piece cinnamon stick
- 1 bay leaf
- the other half of the lemon grass
- 2-3 makrut lime leaves

### protein & vegetables

- roughly 1.5 kg of tempeh/aubergine/potatoes/chicken/beef

### and some more

- 1 cup diluted coconut milk
- 1 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 tbsp [Indonesian ketchup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_soy_sauce) (or replace with soy sauce)


## Preparations

### curry paste

Blend everything for curry paste into a batter-like consistency.
Add some water to aid the process, especially if using tomato concentrate instead of tomatoes.


### pre-cook

- Cut all protein & vegetables into bite-sized pieces.
- If using beef, boil for ~1 hr until tender, or cook in a pressure cooker.
- If using potatoes, boil for ~15 min until cooked but not too soft.
- For tempeh/aubergine/chicken, deep fry until slightly golden in colour.


### cook

- In a wok or deep pan, heat 2 tbsp oil and add curry paste. Cook until fragrant.
- Add pre-cooked protein & vegetables, diluted coconut milk, and the dry spice mix. Cook for 10 min.
- Add brown sugar and soy sauce. Adjust seasoning if needed.
- Serve with rice, and eat!
