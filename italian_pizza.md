## Summary

Nice home-made pizza :D

This recipe makes four small pizzas (about 20 cm in diameter).


## Ingredients

### Dough

- olive oil
- 500g 00 flour / 高筋粉
- 325g water
- 10g salt
- 7.5g instant yeast

### Toppings

- 250g canned tomato
- fresh basil
- 250g fresh mozzarella
- salt and pepper
- some salami / nduja / anything you like
- olive oil


## Preparations

### Dough

- Combine flour, water, salt, instant yeast, knead to a soft dough. Cover tightly and allow it to rise at room temperature for a few hours. If you'd like to have the pizza another day, leave it in the fridge for up to 3-ish days.
- 4 hours before food o'clock, take the dough out of the fridge. Partition into 4 equal pieces, knead until a smooth surface forms. Coat dough with olive oil, and then put them away in 4 separate airtight containers.

### Toppings

- Blend canned tomato to a smooth puree. This will be the base for the pizza.
- Cut mozzarella into small pieces, put them on a colander / sift to drain the water. Put some paper towel on top and place a weight on it, this will help abort more water, so the pizza doesn't come out too watery.
- Cut everything else into appropriate sizes, and pre-cook them if necessary.

## Cooking & Assembly
- Pre-heat your oven to the highest temperature, for me it was 220 degree C.
- Take a cast-iron skillet the size of your pizza, and dust the bottom with flour. Heat it up until it starts to turn brown.
- In the mean time, on a well-floured surface, stretch the pizza dough to your desired size. Don't use a rolling pin as that would take out the air in the dough.
- Turn of the heat, and transfer dough to cast iron pan. Immediately add all your sauce and toppings
- Put skillet in oven and bake for 4-6 minutes, depending on how how good your oven it.
- Once the top is sufficiently browned, take out the skillet and move it the stove top again. Turn on high heat until a nice brown crust forms on the bottom.
- Finish eating this pizza before making the next one.
