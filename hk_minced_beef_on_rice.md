# 免治牛肉飯(Minced beef on rice)

Probably my second favourite dish from Hong Kong. It's almost like a Bolognese sauce, but not quite.
I used the recipe from [JMA Kitchen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNHJ5t0YzGk), but adapted for pressure cooker. If cooking without a pressure cooker, just double the amount of water/stock as well as cooking time.

This makes about 4 servings, and can be refrigerated or frozen if you want to prepare in advance.


## Ingredients

- oil and butter
- stock or water
- 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 4 tbsp milk
- 500g minced beef
- 5 cloves garlic
- 2 yellow onions
- 1 large carrot 
- 6 tbsp tomato concentrate
- (optional) frozen peas

### for the marinade

- 2 tsp oyster sauce 
- 1 tsp white pepper powder
- (optional) 1 tsp [鸡精](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E9%9B%9E%E7%B2%89) or MSG
- 2 tbsp light soy sauce
- 1 tsp sugar
- 4 tsp starch


## Preparations

- In a large bowl, combine beef, oyster sauce (2 tsp), white pepper powder (1 tsp), MSG (1 tsp), light soy sauce (2 tbsp), sugar (1 tsp), and starch (2 tsp, half the amount listed above). Combine and marinate for 15 min.
- Mince or blend garlics, onions, and carrot into a chunky consistency.
- Heat up a pressure cooker, then add some oil followed by the marinated beef. Stir and break up the chunks.
- When the beef is no longer visibly pink, add minced garlic/onion/carrot mixture.
- Stir, and then add 1 tbsp butter and 2 tbsp tomato concentrate. Cook until fragrant.
- Add 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 4 tbsp milk, and frozen peas to your desired quantity.
- Add 250 ml water or stock, and close the pressure cooker lid. After pressure builds up, cook for 15 minutes.
- Make a slurry with the remaining 2 tsp starch and 4 tsp water.
- Let the pressure release naturally. Heat up the pressure cooker again with the lip removed, and add the slurry of starch water.
- Adjust seasoning to taste and cook for 1 more minute.
- Serve over rice, and optionally with a raw egg yolk or a sunny-side up egg on top.
