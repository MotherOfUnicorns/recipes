# 红烧鱼(Fish stew)


## Summary

Usually for fatty fresh-water fish, but also works well with e.g. sea bass.


## Ingredients

- 500 g fish
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 spring onions, green parts only
- 1 tbsp vinegar
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tsp brown sugar
- 1 bay leaf
- 1 star anise

## Preparations

- Clean the fish, and make a few gashes on each side.
- If you don't have a pan large enough to fit the whole fish, then cut it into smaller pieces.
- Chop some spring onion greens for garnish later.
- Cut garlic into slices.
- In a bowl, make a sauce by combining the garlic slices, 1 tbsp vinegar, 2 tbsp soy sauce, 1 tsp brown sugar with half cup water.
- Heat up a pan or a wok, and add 2 tbsp oil.
- Once the pan is hot, sprinkle some salt. (This [helps to avoid the fish getting stuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usdCdWAAqhc).)
- Cook for 3-5 min on each side until the skin is crispy.
- Add sauce and some more water if needed, so that the fish is partially submerged.
- Cook on medium heat for 10 minutes with lid on.
- Flip the fish, and cook for another 5 minutues.
- To finish off, turn heat on high for 1-2 minutes and reduce the liquid.
- Serve with rice.
