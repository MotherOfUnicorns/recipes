# Tortilla

Makes 2 servings: 8 small tortillas (for tacos) or 4 medium ones (for e.g. quesadillas).

## Ingredients

- 150 g all-purpose flour
- 1 tsb salt
- 1.5 tbsp oil/lard/butter
- 80 ml warm water

## Preparations & Cooking

- Mix everything into a dough, and let rest for around 15 minutes.
- Divide into small pieces (according to the size you want). Shape each piece into a smooth, round ball.
- Heat up a cast-iron pan until it's smoking.
- Take one piece of the dough, and roll it out into a round shape using a little flour to prevent sticking.
- Immediately transfer to the hot pan, count 10 Mississippi's, then flip and count 10 more Mississippi's. Finally flip once again and count 10 more Mississippi's.
- The tortilla now should be well cooked and have brown spots on both sides.
