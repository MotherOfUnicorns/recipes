# Naan


Make your own naan on a stovetop (or in a really hot oven, if you have one).


## Ingredients

- 150 g all-purpose flour
- 3 g salt
- 2 g yeast
- 30 g yoghurt
- 70 g warm water
- (optional) nigella seeds / onion seeds / minced garlic


## Preparations

- In a mixing bowl, add flour, salt, yeast, yoghurt, and warm water. Knead to form a smooth dough.
- Cover and let the dough rise in a warm place for about 4 hours.
- Knead the dough again to remove most air.
- Evenly divide the dough into 6 to 8 portions. Shape each into a smooth ball, and cover and let rest for 15 minutes.
- In the mean time, heat up a Dutch oven or very heavy-duty pot with a wide base until smoking.
- Take a ball and roll into a thin layer, using extra flour to prevent sticking.
- If using any of the optional toppings, add them while rolling and make sure the toppings are pressed into the dough.
- Place the piece in your pot, topping side up.
- Cover and cook on high heat. Turn over when the bottom gets browned.
- Serve when both sides are sufficiently covered in brown spots.
