## Summary

Salvage the rotting bananas!


## Ingredients

- 3 soft bananas (roughly 300g)
- 120ml yoghurt
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 60ml vegetable oil
- 150g brown sugar
- 1 egg
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 130g all-purpose flour
- 65g whole wheat flour
- ground nutmeg / cinnamon to taste
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 120g nuts, roughly chopped (optional, I used almonds)


## Preparations
- Preheat oven to 180 degrees C (350 degrees F).
- Spray an 8 x 4 inch (20 x 10 cm) loaf pan with a nonstick vegetable cooking spray, or line the inside with baking paper.
- In a large bowl, mash the bananas, and add yoghurt (120ml), baking soda (1tsp). Allow to sit while you prepare the rest of the batter.
- In a separate bowl, whisk together the vegetable oil (50ml), sugar (150g), 1 egg, and vanilla (1 tsp).
- In another large bowl, whisk together the flours (130g all purpose + 65 whole wheat), baking powder (1 tsp), ground nutmeg / cinnamon and salt (1/4 tsp).
- Combine the banana mixture with the oil mixture, and then add to the flour mixture.
- Stir just until all the ingredients are moistened. Pour into the prepared pan and smooth the top.
- Bake for about 45 - 55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the loaf comes out clean.
- Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool.
