Makes 2 servings. Based on [this seriouseats recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/02/easy-no-knead-olive-rosemary-pistachio-focaccia-kenji-recipe.html).

## Ingredients

### Dough

- 150 g all-purpose flour
- 150 g 00 flour
- 7.5 g salt
- 2 g yeast
- 200 g warm water

### Topping

- 2-3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 2-3 tbsp water
- 1 or 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary
- sprinkle of coarse salt
- (optional) 50 g sliced and pitted olives
- (optional) 2 tbsp pistachios


## Preparations & Cooking

### Dough

- Mix everything into a very soft, very wet dough, cover and let rest in a warm place for a few hours or overnight. Make sure there's plenty of room for the dough to rise.
- Once the dough has risen to 2-3 times the original volume, knead back into a more compact dough, removing as much air as possible.
- In a cast-iron skillet, pour in 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil and coat the bottom and sides of the pan.
- Transfer dough into the skillet, cover and let rise again.
- After 30 minutes, press the dough lightly to flatten and spread it in the skillet.


### Baking

- Pre-heat oven to the highest setting on your oven (for me this is 220 degrees Celsius).
- (optional) Roast the pistachios, and chop roughly into big chunks.
- Remove the rosemary stem, and roughly chop the leaves.
- Mix olive oil, water, and coarse salt with a fork, until the oil and water form a yellow-green coloured emulsion.
- Evenly spread olives, pistachios, and rosemary on the surface of the dough. Lightly press the toppings into the dough.
- Drizzle the oil-water emulsion on top.
- Bake for 25 minutes (might need adjustments depending on your oven setting), until the bottom is crispy.
- Eat.
