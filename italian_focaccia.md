Makes 2 servings. Based on [this seriouseats recipe](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2015/02/easy-no-knead-olive-rosemary-pistachio-focaccia-kenji-recipe.html).

## Ingredients

### Dough

- 250 g all-purpose flour
- 7.5 g salt
- 2 g yeast
- 163 g water

### Topping

- 2 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- 50 g sliced and pitted olives
- 2 tbsp pistachios
- 1 or 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary
- sprinkle of salt


## Preparations & Cooking

### Dough

- Mix everything into a soft dough, cover and let rest in a warm place for 8 - 24 hours. Make sure there's plenty of room for the dough to rise
- On a lightly floured surface, shape the dough into a ball, removing as much air as possible.
- In a cast-iron skillet, pour in 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil and coat the bottom and sides of the pan.
- Transfer dough into the skillet, press it lightly to flatten and spread it in the skillet.
- Cover with plastic wrap and let rest for 2 hours.

### Baking

- Pre-heat oven to the highest setting on your oven (for me this is 220 degrees Celsius).
- Roast the pistachios, and chop roughly into big chunks.
- Remove the rosemary stem, and roughly chop the leaves.
- After the dough has rested for 2 hours, lift up one edge of the dough to let any air bubbles underneath escape and repeat, moving around the dough until there are no air bubbles left underneath and the dough is evenly spread around the skillet.
- Evenly spread olives, pistachios, and rosemary on the surface of the dough. Lightly press the toppings into the dough. Sprinkle with salt.
- Drizzle top with the remaining 1 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
- Bake for 25 minutes (might need adjustments depending on your oven setting), until the bottom is crispy.
- Eat.
