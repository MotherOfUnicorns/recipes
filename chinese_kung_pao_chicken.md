# 宮保雞丁 (Kung Pao Chicken)

This is basically the recipe by the great Fuchsia Dunlop, but I found the seasoning in her version to be a tad too sweet for me.
I find chicken thigh to be much jucier than breast; the cooking time needed for thigh pieces are just a bit longer than breast pieces.
I also usually skip the peanuts in my Kung Pao Chicken.


## Ingredients

### For the marinade

- 300g chicken thigh
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1 tsp Shaoxing wine
- 2 tsp light soy sauce
- 1 tbsp starch
- 2 tbsp cold water

### For the sauce

- 2 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp starch
- 2 tsp dark soy sauce
- 1 tsp light soy sauce
- 2 tbsp Chinese black vinegar
- 2 tbsp water (or chicken stock)
- 1 tsp (Chinese style toasted) sesame oil

### For the stir-fry

- 4 tbsp neutral-tasting cooking oil
- 5 scallions
- 3 cloves garlic
- a knob of ginger, roughly the same amount as the garlic
- 12 large dried chilies, or a few handfuls of small ones
- 2 tsp Sichuan pepper
- (optional) 1/2 cup roasted peanuts


## Preparations

### For the marinade

- Cut chicken into bite-sized pieces.
- In a bowl, add chicken and the rest of the marinade ingredients. Mix well and let it rest on the side.

### For the sauce

- Combine everything for the sauce and mix well. (Remember to mix again before you use it to stir up the starch.)

### For the stir-fry

- Take the white and light-green parts of scallions, and cut into 1/2 inch chunks to match the chicken pieces.
- Slice the garlic and ginger, and add to the same bowl for scallion whites.
- Snip the dried chilies in half if you are using large ones. Remove the seeds if you like it not too spicy.
- Add Sichuan peppers to the same bowl for dried chilies.
- Chop the green parts of the scallions and reserve for garnish.

## Cooking & Assembly

- Check that you have all the ingredients ready:
    * Cooking oil
    * Dried chilies and Sichuan pepper
    * Marinated chicken
    * Scallion whites with garlic and ginger slices
    * Sauce
    * (Optional) peanuts
    * (Optional) scallion greens for garnish
- In a wok, with heat set to high, add cooking oil and swirl.
- Add dried chilies and Sichuan pepper. Stir-fry briefly until they start to darken in colour but not burnt.
- Add chicken pieces. Stir to separate. Cook until the pink colour disappears from the surface.
- Add scallions, garlic, and ginger. Stir-fry until they are fragrant and the chicken just cooked but still tender. (Poke with a chopstick, or cut in half and see if it's still pink inside.)
- Give the sauce a good stir and pour into the center of the wok. Stir till all the chicken pieces are coated.
- (Optional) mix in peanuts and give it another good stir.
- Serve, and garnish with scallion greens.
