### salting the cabbage

- Split the cabbage into quarters by making a cut on the bottom core. Remove the hard part and cut the cabbage into bite-sized pieces.
- In a large container, put down one layer of cabbage followed by one layer of salt. Turn every 30 minutes.
- After 2 hours, thoroughly rinse the cabbage, and drain the water.
- In the meantime, do the other preparations for porridge and spice mix. 

### making the porridge

- Add water and glutinous rice flour in a small pot, cook on medium heat for 10 minutes until it starts to bubble.
- Add sugar and cook for another minute.
- Turn off heat and let cool completely.

### chopping time

- Cut the radish/turnip and carrot into matchsticks.
- Chop up the green onions (and buchu if using).
- Finely mince the garlic, ginger, and onion.

### making the spice paste

- In a large mixing bowl, add the cooled porridge, minced garlic, ginger, and onion. Also add fish sauce, shrimp paste, and gochugaru.
- Mix well into a paste.
- Add the chopped radish/turnip, carrot, green onion (and buchu). Mix well.


## Assembly
